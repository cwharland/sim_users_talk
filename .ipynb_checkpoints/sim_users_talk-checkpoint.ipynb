    "* Design vs Execution vs Scorecard\n",
    "    * Design can add complexity\n",
    "    * Execution is not analysis\n",
    "    * Scorecard is a \"view\" not the truth\n",

    "    * Empirically has had problems\n",
    "    * Many are just incorrect execution\n",
    "    * Some are incorrect aggregation\n",
    "    * Most were fixable with unit testing\n",
    "* Scaling and testing:\n",
